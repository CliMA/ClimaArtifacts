The data includes the in-situ atmospheric forcing and snow measurements for multiple sites across the northern hemisphere; these include precipitation, air temperature, wind speeds, air pressure, air humidity, snow water equivalent, snow depth, albedo, snow temperature. Not all measurements are available or provided at the same cadence for each site.
