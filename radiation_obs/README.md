# Radiative fluxes data from CERES

This artifact contains monthly mean top-of-the-atmosphere and surface radiative fluxes from the 
Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) from March 2000 to October 2019. 
The data includes incoming solar flux, upward shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes, and net radiative fluxes
for all-sky and clear-sky conditions. The net radiative fluxes is positive downward. The resolution is 1 deg x 1 deg.
All fluxes are in W m-2. The data was downloaded from [CERES website](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/) 
in September 2024.
