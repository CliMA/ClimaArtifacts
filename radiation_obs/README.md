# Radiative fluxes data from CERES

This artifact contains monthly mean top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes from the 
Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) from March 2000 to March 2023. 
The data includes incoming solar flux, upward shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes, and net radiative fluxes
for all-sky and clear-sky conditions. The net radiative fluxes is positive downward. All fluxes are in W m-2.
The data can be downloaded from the data repository [Will and Schneider 2024](https://data.caltech.edu/records/z24s9-nqc90).
