# Clima Land forcing data  - ERA5 reanalysis data for 2021
This file holds one year of hourly data of a subset of ERA5 output fields, at
approximately 1 degree of resolution. The fields are
- Latitude ("lat")
- Longitude ("lon")
- Time ("time")
- Temperature at 2 meters (lon, lat, time; "t2m")
- Downwelling SW flux accumulation at surface (lon, lat, time, "ssrd")
- Downwelling LW flux accumulation at surface (lon, lat, time, "strd")
- Neutral wind at 10m, u-component (lon, lat, time, "u10n")
- Neutral wind at 10m, v-component (lon, lat, time, "v10n")
- Surface air pressure (lon, lat, time, "sp")
- Dew point temperature at 2 meters (lon, lat, time, "d2m")
- Total accumulated precipitation (lon, lat, time, "tp")
- Accumulated snowfall (lon, lat, time, "sf")
- Leaf area index, high vegetation (lon, lat, time, "lai_hv")
- Leaf area index, low vegetation (lon, lat, time, "lai_lv")
