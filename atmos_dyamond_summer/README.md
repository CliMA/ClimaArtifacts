# DYAMOND summer initial conditions

## Overview
The DYnamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non-hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) protocol provides a framework for the intercomparison of global storm-resolving models.
This artifact contains the initial conditions needed for the DYAMOND summer simulations, which simulate 40 days and nights, begining on 1 August 2016.
