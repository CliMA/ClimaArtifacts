# Soil freezing data from Mizoguchi, 1990

This artifact contains soil volumetric water content as a function of depth and
time during the freezing soil column experiment described in M. Mizoguchi's
Ph.D. thesis [1].

The data for artifact was obtained by the CliMA team from Figure 4 of reference
[2] using a plot digitizer. No error bars were reported, and we haven't
quantified the error in our estimation of the data from images.
