# Land-sea mask (from ETOPO2022)

## Overview

This collection of artifacts provides a land-sea mask computed from the 30
arc-second ETOPO2022 orography information.
- `landsea_mask_30arcseconds/landsea_mask.nc` (30 arc-second, compressed, 2MB)
- `landsea_mask_60arcseconds/landsea_mask.nc` (60 arc-second, compressed, 0.5MB)
- `landsea_mask_1deb/landsea_mask.nc` (1 degree, compressed, 5kB)

This mask is generated by identifying connected basins below a predefined
sea-level (set as 0 in this artifact) and marking them as "land" if they are smaller
than a given size. The size is provided as fraction of the surface of the globe
(where the ocean is 65 %). This artifact has all the lakes filled, so that it
identifies as land everything that is not ocean. Generating this mask is
memory-intensive: for the 30 arcsecond dataset, it requires 50 GB of RAM.

The name of the variable in the dataset is `landsea` and the data type is an
Int8: 0 is ocean, 1 is land. In the future, we might include lakes as well.

Note also that the data is compressed. If this leads to problems, please open an
issue. Uncompressed data requires 400x more space.
