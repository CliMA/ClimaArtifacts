# Albedo Data from CESM2

## Overview

This artifact contains scripts that process two Community Earth System Model 2 data files
and creates two output files that contain Albedo data. Below is a detailed description of
each file and its purpose.

## Usage

To recreate the artifact:

Run `julia --project create_artifact.jl`

## Input Files

### 1. `rsds_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc`

This netCDF file contains Surface Upwelling Shortwave Radiation in the variable `rsus`.
This variables is defined on the longitude, latitude, and time dimensions. `rsus` is taken as
the montly average, with the first data point at 15/01/1850 12:00 and the las at 15/12/2014 12:00.
This data file can be downloaded from [LLNL](https://aims3.llnl.gov/thredds/fileServer/css03_data/CMIP6/CMIP/NCAR/CESM2/historical/r1i1p1f1/Amon/rsds/gn/v20190308/rsds_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc
)

### 2. `rsus_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc`

This netCDF file contains Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation in the variable `rsds`.
This variables is defined on the longitude, latitude, and time dimensions. `rsds` is taken as
the montly average, with the first data point at 15/01/1850 12:00 and the las at 15/12/2014 12:00.
This data file can be downloaded from [LLNL](https://aims3.llnl.gov/thredds/fileServer/css03_data/CMIP6/CMIP/NCAR/CESM2/historical/r1i1p1f1/Amon/rsus/gn/v20190308/rsus_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc
)

## Output Files

### 1. `sw_albedo_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412_v2_no-nans.nc`

This netCDF file contains shortwave albedo in the variable `sw_alb`. The variable is defined
on the longitude, latitude, and time dimensions. `sw_alb` is taken as the montly average,
with the first data point at 15/01/1850 12:00 and the las at 15/12/2014 12:00. `sw_alb` is
calculated by dividing Surface Upwelling Shortwave Radiation by Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation.
At any point, if Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation is zero, `sw_alb` is set to 1.0.
`sw_alb` is stored as a Float32.

### 2. `bareground_albedo.nc`

This netCDF file contains average shortwave albedo in the summer for each hemisphere.
The variable is defined on the longitude and latitude. In the northern hemisphere the average
is taken of shortwave albedo during May, June, and July. In the southern hemisphere the average
is taken of shortwave albedo during December and January.
At any point, if data is missing, `sw_alb` is set to 1.0.
`sw_alb` is stored as a Float32.

## Scripts

### `calculate_sw_alb.jl`

This script processes `rsds_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc` and
`rsus_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc` to create
`sw_albedo_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412_v2_no-nans.nc`. This is done by
dividing `rsus` by `rsds`, and assigning a value of 1.0 when `rsds` is zero.

### `calculate_bareground_alb.jl`

This script processes `sw_albedo_Amon_CESM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412_v2_no-nans.nc`
to create `bareground_albedo.nc` This is done by averaging the input `sw_alb` during the
summer months for each hemisphere. To do this, first mean albedo is calulated globally
for the northern hemisphere summer months. Then, mean albedo is calulated globally
for the southern hemisphere summer months. Then, these two mean albedo's are merged, with the
northern hemisphere set to the average during the northen hemisphere summer months and the
southern hemisphere set to the average during the southern hemisphere summer months
