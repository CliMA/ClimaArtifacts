# Measured sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature

This artifact redistributes NCAR's "Merged Hadley-OI sea surface temperature and
sea ice concentration data set".

Quoting from the [original
source](https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/158_asphilli.html):

> The merged Hadley-OI sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration
> (SIC) data sets were specifically developed as surface forcing data sets for
> AMIP style uncoupled simulations of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). The
> Hadley Centre's SST/SIC version 1.1 (HADISST1), which is derived gridded,
> bias-adjusted in situ observations, were merged with the NOAA-Optimal
> Interpolation (version 2; OI.v2) analyses. The HADISST1 spanned 1870 onward
> but the OI.v2, which started in November 1981, better resolved features such
> as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current which are important components of the
> climate system. Since the two data sets used different development methods,
> anomalies from a base period were used to create a more homogeneous record.
> Also, additional adjustments were made to the SIC data set.
